## Overview
This project uses Python to analyze bikeshare data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. 

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive environment where users can choose the dataset to analyze. 
With the help of Python, we calculate statistics and provide insightful analysis to users.


## Requirements
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x installed on your local machine. 
You will also need to install pandas, numpy, and time libraries.


## Instructions
To use this project, simply download the repository to your local machine and run python bikeshare.py. 
The program will prompt the user to choose a city, month, and day to analyze. The program will then calculate statistics and provide insights based on the user's choices.

## Screenshots
#### Interactive User Interface
Our bikeshare data analysis program provides an interactive user experience that allows users to see their needs, making it easy to quickly find answers to specific questions.

The first four images show different parts of the user interface, where users can choose the city, month, day of the week, or combination of these options to analyze.

#### Data Analysis Based on User's Choices
Once the user enters the desired options, the program calculates statistics and provides insightful analysis based on the user's choices. 

The next two images show different parts of the analysis results. The program presents the data in a clear and easy-to-understand format, making it simple to draw meaningful conclusions.

#### Asking the User to See Part of Dataset
The last image shows how the program asks the user if they want to see a part of the dataset. This feature allows users to explore the data and see the details behind the analysis, making it easy to verify the accuracy of the results.
